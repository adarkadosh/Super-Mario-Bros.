# 🍄 Super Mario Clone – Unity 6 Game Project

A faithful 2D clone of the original *Super Mario Bros*, developed using **Unity 6** and **C#** with the **New Input System**.  
All gameplay logic, player controls, and mechanics were built from scratch as part of a personal learning project.

> 💻 All code was written independently, with occasional help from AI tools (like ChatGPT) for code suggestions and debugging.

| `P`            | Pause/Resume game  |
