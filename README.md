# Cheat Codes - Restart & Pause Game

This project includes basic cheat codes to **Restart** and **Pause/Resume** the game using simple keyboard shortcuts.

## ðŸ”¥ Cheat Codes
| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Ctrl + R** | Restart the game |
| **P** | Toggle Pause/Resume |

## ðŸŽ® How It Works
- **Restart Game (Ctrl + R)**  
  - Press **Left Control** and **R** at the same time.  
  - This reloads the current scene, effectively restarting the game.  

- **Pause/Resume Game (P)**  
  - Press **P** to toggle between **Paused** and **Resumed** states.  
  - When paused, game time is set to `0`, stopping all movements and actions.  
  - Press **P** again to resume the game.  

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- This script does **not** require the **New Input System**; it uses Unityâ€™s classic `Input.GetKey` method.
- Works in both **Editor** and **Build** mode.
